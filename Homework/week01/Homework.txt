Using the Bayside Beats example from class create a similar page for Perth using the River foreshore as focus. Select some interesting facts about Perth that may be of interest to a visitor to Perth. 
Some websites to check out for tourist information are:
Government Tourism Western Australia site - http://www.westernaustralia.com/au/Pages/Welcome_to_Western_Australia.aspx#/
Perth City Council website - https://www.perth.wa.gov.au/
Guide to Western  Australia - http://www.australia.com/en/places/wa.html
WA Holiday - http://www.waholidayguide.com.au/explore-wa

Instructions

1. Ensure that the meta tag for the view port is correct by including the initial scale as shown here: 
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
2. Now we will create the body of the page. Start with a div tag to wrap the contents of the page we are building. 
3. Create the basic structure for the navigation structure for the site. This should include:
home page 
places to visit
places to eat
things to do
Where to stay and
contact page
We will add these pages as the weeks go by. 
<header id="top">
        <h1>Riverside Beat</h1>
        <nav>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="index.html" class="thispage">Home</a></li>
                <li><a href="sightseeing.html">Sightseeing</a></li>
                <li><a href="#">Eating Out</a></li>
                <li><a href="#">What's On</a></li>
                <li><a href="#">Where to Stay</a></li>

            </ul>
        </nav>
    </header>

4. Create the structure for a hero section that will highlight why people should visit the Perth Riverside.
  <div class="hero">
        <article>
            <h2>Be Where It&rsquo;s At</h2>
            <p>
               copy goes here
            </p>
        </article>
        <img src=""  alt=""/> 
</div>

Pixabay.com has images of Perth and there are plenty through a search for "Perth, WA Images". Be aware of copyright though. Ensure that you can reuse them. Images should be an absolute URL linking to the image location on the web.

5. Create two sections so that we have a main area and a sidebar.
<section class="col-1">    
   <article">
      <h2>Article title here</h2>
      <p>Information about Free Cat buses and where they run from</p>
      <p>second paragraph if needed</p>
      <figure class="centered"><img src="" width="400" height="266"  alt=""/>
            <figcaption>caption for image</figcaption>
      </figure>
       <p>3rd paragraph as needed</p>
   </article>
</section>
<section class="col-2"
    <aside class="sidebar">
        <h2>Article title here</h2>
        <p>Tips on how to get to various attractions around town using CAT Buses</p>
        <p>2nd paragraph if needed</p>
    </aside>
</section>

6. Now create the footer so that you have a copyright statement.
    <footer>
        <p>&copy; Copyright 2017 Riverside Beat</p>
    </footer>

This completes the homework for Lesson 1
